<p>We are still working with text mining. Today we are going to create a wordcloud using the positive &amp; negative sentiments mined from the text.</p>
<p>Just as always, we begin my loading (and library) the packages that we’ll use today: dplyr, gutenbergr, tidytext, tm (don’t have to library), wordcloud &amp; (new) wordcloud2 &amp; (also new) reshape2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(gutenbergr)
library(tidytext)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
library(wordcloud2)
library(reshape2)</code></pre>
<p>Now we need some text; we’ll download the novel Dracula from gutenbergr we’ve been working with this for a while &amp; we know the download # is 345.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula&lt;-gutenberg_download(345)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Determining mirror for Project Gutenberg from http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Using mirror http://aleph.gutenberg.org</code></pre>
<p>Then we will ‘unpack’ the text column by unnesting the tokens with tidy text to get the words in Dracula. We’ll save this to a data frame Dracula_words.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words&lt;-dracula%&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)</code></pre>
<p>We aren’t going to worry about the stop words (a, an, the, etc.) because we are going to work with ‘bing’ to rate the words as positive or negative.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bing&lt;-get_sentiments(&#39;bing&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We’ll look at the data frame for dracula_words &amp; bing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 162,577 x 2
##    gutenberg_id         word
##           &lt;int&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;
##  1          345      dracula

##  9          345         york
## 10          345      grosset
## # ... with 162,567 more rows</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>bing</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6,788 x 2

##          &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;

##  2     2-faces  negative
##  3          a+  positive
##  4    abnormal  negative
##  5     abolish  negative
##  6  abominable  negative
##  7  abominably  negative
##  8   abominate  negative

## # ... with 6,778 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Dracula Words has 3 columns: the line number, Gutenberg id number &amp; the word. Bing is the list of words &amp; the sentiment attached to each word as positive or negative. We’ll join the Dracula words &amp; bing together.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words&lt;-inner_join(dracula_words,bing)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Joining, by = &quot;word&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>head(dracula_words)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   gutenberg_id      word sentiment
##          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;
## 1          345       beg  negative
## 2          345 wonderful  positive
## 3          345   correct  positive
## 4          345  splendid  positive
## 5          345     noble  positive
## 6          345    pretty  positive</code></pre>
<p>Now we have 4 columns: the line number, Gutenberg id number, the word &amp; the sentiment. We don’t need the Gutenberg id number column so we’ll get rid of that with NULL.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words$gutenberg_id&lt;-NULL
head(dracula_words)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##        word sentiment
##       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;
## 1       beg  negative
## 2 wonderful  positive
## 3   correct  positive
## 4  splendid  positive
## 5     noble  positive
## 6    pretty  positive</code></pre>
<p>We now have the information we want to make a word cloud.</p>
<div id="wordcloud" class="section level1">
<h1>Wordcloud</h1>
<p>To get a wordcloud, we need to group the words &amp; count by the sentiment. We’ll use freq(frequency) for n (rather than count.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words&lt;-dracula_words%&gt;%
  group_by(word)%&gt;%
  summarize(freq=n(),sentiment=first(sentiment))</code></pre>
<p>Now a simple wordcloud: We’ll have to add the “message=FALSE,warning=FALSE” to supress error messages because some of the word’s won’t fit.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wordcloud(dracula_words$word, dracula_words$freq,min.freq = 11)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/blog-2017-11-13-wordcloud_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now let’s try wordcloud2, the new package we installed for today. For wordcloud 2 we need ca column for word &amp; a column frequency (freq).</p>

<div id="wordcloud2" class="section level1">

<p>The other new package we installed is reshape2. This allows us to get a comparison wordcoud. We need to change our data frame into a matrix. The ‘word’ column becomes our ‘row’ with each word representing a row &amp; then we add/create 2 columns (‘negative &amp; positive’).<br />
We don’t want to see an ‘NA’ in our matrix so we need to make the NA 0 (zero) fill = 0 is for Na to be 0 There will be a 0 (zero) in the positive column for negative words &amp; a 0 (zero) in the negative column for positive words. The code is: “acast(dracula_words,word~sentiment,value.var=‘freq’,fill =0)”</p>
<p>We’ll save this into a variable dracula_matrix &amp; look at the head.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_matrix&lt;-acast(dracula_words,word~sentiment,value.var=&#39;freq&#39;,fill =0)
head(dracula_matrix)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##              negative positive
## abnormal            1        0
## absence             2        0
## abyss               1        0
## accidental          1        0
## accomplished        0        3
## accurate            0        8</code></pre>
<p>We see the word and then a negative and positive column. The totals for each word are summed in these columns.</p>
<p>With wordcloud2 the comparison cloud is easy to code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparison.cloud(dracula_matrix)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/blog-2017-11-13-wordcloud_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The positive &amp; negative are in different colors. We can choose our own colors using colors=c((‘black’, ‘orange’). We can use the htmlcolor codes that we find on the web too</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparison.cloud(dracula_matrix,colors=c(&#39;black&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/blog-2017-11-13-wordcloud_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now our positive sentiments are orange &amp; our negative sentiments are black.</p>

<h1>Using Wordcloud 2 to ‘shape’ our cloud</h1>
<p>Go out to google &amp; find some clipart. Since this is a Halloween theme, we’ll look for a bat. When we google ’free clip art bat&quot; Download the .jpg, .gif, or .png file the clipart &amp; put it in your working directory with your R script document. For the blog, we’ll need to save it to our images in the image folder.</p>
<p>Then we just add fig=‘filename.jpg’ &amp; it will shape the cloud.</p>
